The file "CallypsoTraining.pth" is a PyTorch model file, not a code file. It contains the weights and architecture of a pre-trained model, in this case, the voice model. It is not possible to generate code for this file as it is a binary file generated by training a model. The file is used by loading it into a PyTorch model in the Python code.
